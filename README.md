We propose XMatchAD, a novel method for multi-class anomaly detection. We reinterpret reconstruction-based UAD as a pseudo cross-modal matching process, where the input image and its reconstructed counterpart are treated as two pseudo modalities. Under this perspective, anomaly score maps are generated through local matching using the window-based cross-attention mechanism.
